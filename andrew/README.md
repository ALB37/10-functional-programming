# Code 301 Lab 10 functional programming

**Andrew Bloom**
**Version 1.0.9**

## Overview
1. I forked the lab 10 repo for this lab into my GitHub account. I created a new branch with my name and began work.
2. I first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. I started by working through the todo's in article.js. Then I worked through the articleView.js todo's and then the script function calls at the bottom of the html pages. After working through each of the todo's and reviews, I worked on getting everything to work as required.
3. Last I worked on updating the README and completing any remaining non-coding tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, install node and any dependencies you don't already have installed.

## Architecture
The focus of this lab was to implement functional programming into our app that we have been working on for the past week.  Ajax, jQuery, postgres and express were used.
