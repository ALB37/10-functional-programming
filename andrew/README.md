# Code 301 Lab 10 functional programming

**Andrew Bloom**
**Version 1.0.9**

## Overview
1. I forked the lab 10 repo for this lab into my GitHub account. I created a new branch with my name and began work.
2. I first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. I started by working through the todo's in server.js, keeping article.js open split-right for comparison. After working through each of the todo's and reviews, we ran the tests required; they all passed.
3. Last we worked on updating the README and completing any remaining tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and initialize node and install all of the dependencies.

## Architecture
The focus of this lab was reviewing code in server.js to make a server.  Ajax, jQuery, postgres and express were used.

## Change Log
**No changes currently**

## Credits and Collaborations
Modified by Andrew Bloom. Based off of the starter code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. Using jQuery, Handlebars, highlighting.js, marked.js, and ExpressJS libraries.
